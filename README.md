# pre-commit-shellcheck
A pre-commit hook for ShellCheck.

## Why another one?
There are environments where tools like Docker are not available or where downloads are not possible (maybe because of a company proxy).

This pre-commit hook includes the executable files so that no other external tools or downloads are necessary.
